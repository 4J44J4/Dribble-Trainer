# Dribble-Trainer
A Rocket League plugin that helps players improve their ball control on the ground. It works by teleporting the ball and car to the opposite side of the arena when it gets too close to the walls, creating a boundless field to practice in.

Look in this plugin's tab in the bakkesmod plugins tab for settings, and apply the keybinds that start with AIRDRIBBLETRAINER::* in the keybinds tab to activate/deactivate it.
